# README #

This is an arbit collection of code and artifacts of small projects that I indulge in every once in a while. There's really no rhyme or reason for what it contains - its just meant to be a miscellaneous collection of code that I occasionally look at.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Documenting some cpp/py/MATLAB code
* Keeping track of a handful of hobby projects

### How do I get set up? ###

Look into subfolders based on language, and play away (cpp code typically has makefiles)

### Who do I talk to? ###
